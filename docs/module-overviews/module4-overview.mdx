# Module 4: Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to Module 4 of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics course. This module focuses on the specialized field of humanoid robotics, exploring the unique challenges and solutions involved in creating anthropomorphic robots. You'll learn about biomechanics, locomotion, dexterity, and the complex control systems required for human-like behaviors.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Understand the biomechanical principles underlying humanoid robot design
- Implement stable bipedal locomotion and balance control systems
- Design dexterous manipulation systems for humanoid hands and arms
- Program human-like behaviors and social interactions for humanoid robots
- Integrate all previous modules' concepts into a complete humanoid system

## Module Structure

This module consists of five comprehensive chapters that build upon each other to provide a complete understanding of humanoid robotics:

1. **Biomechanics and Anthropomorphic Design** – Understanding Human-Inspired Robot Architecture
2. **Bipedal Locomotion and Balance Control** – Walking, Standing, and Dynamic Stability
3. **Dexterous Manipulation** – Humanoid Hands, Grasping, and Fine Motor Control
4. **Human-Like Behaviors and Expressions** – Social Robotics and Non-Verbal Communication
5. **Integration and Control of Complete Humanoid Systems** – Bringing It All Together

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have:
- Completion of Modules 1, 2, and 3 (ROS 2, Simulation, and Physical AI fundamentals)
- Understanding of kinematics and dynamics
- Knowledge of control theory and feedback systems
- Experience with complex robotic systems integration

## Real-World Applications

Humanoid robotics is applied in:
- Assistive robotics for elderly care and disability support
- Human-robot interaction research and social robotics
- Entertainment and customer service applications
- Hazardous environment exploration and assistance
- Research platforms for understanding human cognition and movement

## Getting Started

Begin with Chapter 1 to understand the biomechanical principles that guide humanoid robot design. Each chapter includes practical examples, control algorithm implementations, and exercises to reinforce your learning.
