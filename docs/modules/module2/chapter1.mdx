## Simulation Fidelity and the Reality Gap

### The Reality Gap Challenge

The "reality gap" refers to the differences between simulated and real-world environments that can affect the transfer of learned behaviors or validated designs from simulation to reality.

- **Physics Approximation**: Simplified physics models vs. real-world complexity
- **Sensor Modeling**: Inaccurate simulation of sensor noise and limitations
- **Environmental Factors**: Unmodeled environmental influences
- **Hardware Imperfections**: Real-world actuator and sensor imperfections

### Bridging the Reality Gap

#### Domain Randomization
```python
# Example of domain randomization in simulation
import numpy as np

def randomize_environment():
    # Randomize physical parameters within realistic bounds
    friction_coeff = np.random.uniform(0.1, 0.9)
    gravity = np.random.uniform(9.7, 9.9)  # m/s^2
    mass_variance = np.random.uniform(0.95, 1.05)  # 5% variance
    return {
        'friction': friction_coeff,
        'gravity': gravity,
        'mass_multiplier': mass_variance
    }
```

#### Sim-to-Real Transfer Techniques
