# Hardware Requirements

This section outlines the recommended hardware specifications for effectively engaging with the "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics" textbook, particularly for modules involving simulation and AI-intensive tasks. While some sections can be completed with minimal hardware, a capable system will significantly enhance your learning experience.

## Minimum Requirements

*   **Processor**: Quad-core CPU (Intel i5 or AMD Ryzen 5 equivalent or better)
*   **RAM**: 8 GB RAM
*   **Storage**: 256 GB SSD (Solid State Drive)
*   **Operating System**: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (recommended for ROS 2 and NVIDIA Isaac compatibility) or Windows 10/11 with WSL2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux 2).
*   **Graphics Card**: Integrated graphics capable of supporting basic display requirements.

## Recommended Specifications

For optimal performance, especially when working with NVIDIA Isaac Sim, high-fidelity Unity simulations, and complex AI models, we strongly recommend the following:

*   **Processor**: Hexa-core (6-core) CPU or higher (Intel i7/i9 or AMD Ryzen 7/9 equivalent or better)
*   **RAM**: 16 GB RAM or more
*   **Storage**: 512 GB NVMe SSD or larger
*   **Operating System**: Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
*   **Graphics Card**: Dedicated NVIDIA GPU with at least 8 GB VRAM (e.g., NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 or newer, or equivalent workstation GPU). NVIDIA GPUs are crucial for leveraging the full capabilities of NVIDIA Isaac Sim and other CUDA-accelerated AI frameworks.

## Software Environment

In addition to hardware, ensure you have the following software installed:

*   **ROS 2**: Humble Hawksbill or newer (for Ubuntu).
*   **Python**: Version 3.8 or higher.
*   **Node.js & npm**: For Docusaurus website development.
*   **Docker & Docker Compose**: For containerized development environments.
*   **Git**: For version control.
*   **Visual Studio Code**: Recommended IDE with relevant extensions (e.g., Python, Docker, ROS).

## Cloud Resources (Optional)

For those without access to recommended local hardware, cloud-based GPU instances (e.g., AWS EC2, Google Cloud, Azure) can be utilized for compute-intensive tasks, particularly those involving NVIDIA Isaac Sim. Instructions for setting up cloud environments may be provided in relevant modules.
