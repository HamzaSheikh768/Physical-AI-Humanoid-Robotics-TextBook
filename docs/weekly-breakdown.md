# Weekly Breakdown

This section provides a suggested weekly breakdown for engaging with the "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics" textbook. This schedule is designed to help you pace your learning and effectively cover all the material, including theoretical concepts, practical exercises, and project work. Feel free to adjust this breakdown to suit your individual learning style and availability.

## Suggested Schedule (12 Weeks)

### Week 1-3: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

*   **Week 1**: Introduction to ROS 2, nodes, topics, and basic communication patterns.
*   **Week 2**: ROS 2 services, actions, and creating your first custom ROS 2 package.
*   **Week 3**: URDF for robot description, RViz visualization, and advanced ROS 2 client library features.

### Week 4-6: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

*   **Week 4**: Introduction to Gazebo, world building, and integrating simple robots.
*   **Week 5**: High-fidelity visualization with Unity, setting up the Unity-ROS bridge.
*   **Week 6**: Advanced sensor simulation (cameras, LiDAR, IMU) and data integration.

### Week 7-9: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac)

*   **Week 7**: Introduction to NVIDIA Isaac Sim, synthetic data generation for AI.
*   **Week 8**: Perception with Isaac ROS, object detection, and pose estimation.
*   **Week 9**: Navigation, mapping (SLAM), path planning, and obstacle avoidance.

### Week 10-12: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) & Capstone Project

*   **Week 10**: Introduction to VLA models, voice-to-action systems (Whisper, LLMs).
*   **Week 11**: Cognitive planning with LLMs for complex task execution.
*   **Week 12**: Capstone Project - Integrating all learned concepts to build an autonomous humanoid robot with VLA capabilities.

## Project Work & Assessments

Throughout the course, dedicate time each week to reinforce your understanding through:

*   **Code Exercises**: Implement and experiment with the concepts introduced in each chapter.
*   **Mini-Projects**: Apply your knowledge to small, focused robotics challenges.
*   **Module Assessments**: Review and test your understanding at the end of each major module.
*   **Capstone Project**: The final project integrates all aspects of the textbook, demonstrating comprehensive knowledge and practical skills.
