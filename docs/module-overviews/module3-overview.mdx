# Module 3: Physical AI Fundamentals

Welcome to Module 3 of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics course. This module delves into the intersection of artificial intelligence and physical robotics, exploring how AI algorithms are embodied in physical systems. You'll learn about perception systems, decision-making processes, and control mechanisms that enable robots to interact intelligently with the physical world.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Understand the principles of Physical AI and embodied cognition
- Implement perception systems for robots using sensors and computer vision
- Design AI decision-making systems for robotic applications
- Integrate AI models with robot control systems
- Evaluate the challenges and opportunities in Physical AI

## Module Structure

This module consists of five comprehensive chapters that build upon each other to provide a complete understanding of Physical AI:

1. **From Perception to Action** – Understanding the Physical AI Loop
2. **Sensor Fusion for Physical AI** – Combining Multiple Sensory Inputs
3. **Learning in Physical Systems** – Reinforcement Learning and Imitation Learning
4. **Planning and Navigation in Physical AI** – Pathfinding and Obstacle Avoidance
5. **Human-Robot Interaction in Physical AI** – Social Robotics and Collaboration

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have:
- Completion of Modules 1 and 2 (ROS 2 and Simulation fundamentals)
- Understanding of basic machine learning concepts
- Familiarity with Python for AI development
- Knowledge of basic control theory concepts

## Real-World Applications

Physical AI is applied in:
