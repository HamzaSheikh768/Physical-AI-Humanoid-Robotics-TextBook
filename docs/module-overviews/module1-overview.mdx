# Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

Welcome to Module 1 of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics course. This module introduces you to ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2), which serves as the universal nervous system for physical robots. You'll explore how ROS 2 enables complex robotic systems to communicate, coordinate, and execute sophisticated behaviors.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Understand the fundamental architecture of ROS 2 and its real-time, distributed capabilities
- Implement core communication primitives including topics, services, and actions
- Develop robotic applications using Python with ROS 2 packages and workspaces
- Describe complex humanoid robots using URDF and Xacro

## Module Structure

This module consists of five comprehensive chapters that build upon each other to provide a complete understanding of ROS 2:

1. **From Digital AI to Physical Robots** – Why ROS 2 is the Universal Nervous System
2. **ROS 2 Architecture Deep Dive** – Real-Time, Distributed, Robot-Grade Reliability
3. **Core Communication Primitives** – Topics, Services, Actions, Parameters
4. **Building Real Robots in Python** – Packages, Workspaces, Launch, rclpy Mastery
5. **URDF & Xacro** – Describing Complex Humanoid Bodies

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have:
- Basic understanding of programming concepts (variables, functions, classes)
- Familiarity with Python programming language
- Understanding of basic robotics concepts (sensors, actuators, control systems)
- Experience with command-line interfaces

## Real-World Applications

ROS 2 is used extensively in industry and research for:
- Autonomous vehicles and mobile robots
- Industrial automation and manufacturing
- Service robots and human-robot interaction
- Research platforms in universities and labs
- Humanoid robotics development

## Getting Started

Begin with Chapter 1 to understand the foundational concepts of ROS 2 and how it bridges the gap between digital AI algorithms and physical robotic systems. Each chapter includes practical examples, code snippets, and exercises to reinforce your learning.
