# Assessments

This section outlines the various assessment methods used in conjunction with the "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics" textbook to evaluate your understanding and practical skills. Assessments are designed to reinforce learning, provide feedback, and measure your progress throughout the course.

## Types of Assessments

*   **Quizzes**: Short, module-specific quizzes to test theoretical knowledge and comprehension of key concepts.
*   **Programming Assignments**: Hands-on coding tasks that require you to apply ROS 2, simulation, and AI techniques to solve robotics problems.
*   **Mini-Projects**: Small-scale projects that integrate multiple concepts from a module, culminating in a functional robotic component or simulation.
*   **Peer Reviews**: Opportunities to review and provide feedback on the work of your peers, enhancing your understanding and critical evaluation skills.
*   **Capstone Project**: A comprehensive final project that requires you to design, implement, and demonstrate an autonomous humanoid robot system, integrating all major concepts from the textbook.

## Grading Criteria

Assessments will be evaluated based on:

*   **Correctness**: Accuracy of code, solutions, and conceptual understanding.
*   **Completeness**: Fulfillment of all requirements and objectives for the assignment.
*   **Code Quality**: Readability, maintainability, and efficiency of your code.
*   **Documentation**: Clarity and thoroughness of explanations, comments, and project reports.
*   **Innovation (for Capstone)**: Creativity and originality in problem-solving and system design.

## Feedback and Iteration

Feedback will be provided for all assessments to help you improve your understanding and skills. We encourage an iterative approach to learning, where you can apply feedback to refine your solutions and deepen your knowledge.

## Academic Integrity

All work submitted for assessments must be your own. Collaboration is encouraged for learning and discussion, but direct copying or unauthorized use of others' work is strictly prohibited. Plagiarism will result in serious academic penalties.
